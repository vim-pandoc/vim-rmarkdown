- SETUP                                                 *quarto-vim-setup*

quarto-vim requires 

1) the |vim-pandoc-syntax| plugin. 
    See https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax
2) the quarto publishing system
    https://quarto.org

quarto-vim's repo uses the typical bundle layout, so it's very simple to
install using some plugin manager such as pathogen, Vundle or NeoBundle. For
example, using Vundle you should add

    Plugin 'vim-pandoc/vim-pandoc-syntax'
    Plugin 'quarto-dev/quarto-vim'

to your .vimrc, source it, and execute |:PluginInstall|.


- USAGE                                                 *quarto-vim-usage*

Files with the .qmd extension are automatically detected as Quarto files, 
and quarto-vim loads vim-pandoc-syntax for .qmd files.

- SYNTAX                                               *vim-rmarkdown-syntax*

quarto-vim extends pandoc's markdown syntax so that:

    ```{python}
    import numpy as np
    np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
    ```

    ```{r}
    summary(cars)
    ```
are recognized as Python and R code cells.

Inline R is also handled for the knitr engine:

    inline unformatted text like `r 1 + 2` 

R and Python syntax is used within such fenced codeblocks and inline spans.
